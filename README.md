# Bookbot
Boot.dev first guided project!

This space will hold all the files and working code for the guided project. I'll try and remember to update this from time to time as well...

## Pacing
This can go rather quickly. However, it was fun and something that you can focus through in an hour or so, which is quite nice.

## New ideas 
There are a few new concepts brought into this, and more freedom than I expected. 

### Freedoms
Commit timing and pushes are entirely up to you (minus the final git push to ensure the project is complete). This seemed odd to me at first, but the freedom was quite nice. 

The functions you are asked to create don't give you much information besides requirements. I would imagine that this is relatively on par with a work environment where there wouldn't be much handholding. 

### New ideas
There are few new concepts like dictionary sorting and report crafting that I haven't been exposed to before. This did cause me to do some good old fashion googlin and to ask for boots for help. 

## Final thoughts. 
Great intro project. Covered a lot of bases, and most importantly (to me) help me get comfortable with using git and github for projects.
